# Nebular
## Description
 
For almost half of my career, I used JavaScript for creating UI. A few years back, I started to see these art installations popping up here and there all over NYC, so I gave them a shot and visited a few. Great experience, and the art is some immersive that you truly feel inside of it. My favorite were these interactive particles generated with code, and that's what this little project is aboutâ€”maybe using JS for something that is not UX/UI.

## What I'll be using
There are plenty of libraries that can create this sort of generative art here on GitHub. I bumped into one called [Canvas-Sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) by artist [Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl) since the requirements to install and run were pretty much having NodeJS. **Check that out that repo!**

## Following this project
The best way for me to organize this project was exploring the library and so I broke down this on a GitHub project that you can also check the progress [here](https://github.com/users/nelmerdlc/projects/5/views/1)
